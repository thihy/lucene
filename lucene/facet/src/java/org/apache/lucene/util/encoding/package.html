<title>Encoding</title>
</head>
<body>
Offers various encoders and decoders for integers, as well as the
mechanisms to create new ones. The super class for all encoders is
{@link org.apache.lucene.util.encoding.IntEncoder} and for most of the
encoders there is a matching {@link
org.apache.lucene.util.encoding.IntDecoder} implementation (not all
encoders need a decoder).
<p>
Some encoders don't perform any encoding at all, or do not include an
encoding logic. Those are called {@link
org.apache.lucene.util.encoding.IntEncoderFilter}s. A filter is an
encoder which delegates the encoding task to a given encoder, however
performs additional logic before the values are sent for encoding. An
example is {@link org.apache.lucene.util.encoding.DGapIntEncoder}
which encodes the gaps between values rather than the values themselves.
Another example is {@link
org.apache.lucene.util.encoding.SortingIntEncoder} which sorts all the
values in ascending order before they are sent for encoding.
