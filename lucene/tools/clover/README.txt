Hi,
Atlassian are excited to be presenting Apache with a site license for Clover
2.6.

This Clover license can be used for any code that is under an org.apache
package. Further, this license can be used by any developer on their machine
in conjunction with our Eclipse or IntelliJ plugins for development on an
org.apache project.

[license]

Hi Mike,

That would be great if you could forward this to committers@apache.org.
The license is available to anyone working on the org.apache.* be it 
in IDEA/Eclipse/Ant/Maven locally, or on a central build server.

Since the license will only instrument and report coverage on 
org.apache packages, please mention that it is fine to commit this 
license to each project if it makes running builds easier. ie just 
check out the project and run with Clover, without the need for the 
extra step of locating and installing the clover license.

Cheers,
Nick
